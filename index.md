## Hi There! ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤š

### About Me

I'm Grant, a developer, system architect and keen musician that lives in Sydney, Australia.

I've been building and fixing web systems for quite some time now, recently as Ecommerce Architect for [Made.com Designs](https://www.made.com) (before they messed up their post-IPO finances and imploded). Working at scale in an environment that combined both macro and micro services was fun and educational.  London was great back in the pre-COVID days, but during the pandemic I decided it was time to get closer to home and family back in Oz.

Right now I'm working with [Foodbomb](https://foodbomb.com.au) as a Senior Software Engineer, primarily on integrations and upgrading legacy systems to be more modern and emit webhooks and use events internally.

### Other Things

I studied music up to university / conservatorium level and I've a deep love for well-written interesting music, right across the spectrum from classical through jazz to electronic. I write music and play keyboards as a fairly serious hobby.  [Here are some tracks that I produced on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/grantoz).

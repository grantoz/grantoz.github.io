### About me

I'm a web developer and system architect that lives in beautiful Sydney, Australia.

Professionally, I've been involved in building and fixing web systems for over 20 years, particularly e-commerce systems.   I spend a lot of time looking at things that happen on e-commerce systems, and not enough time writing about them, so this site is an attempt to remedy that situation somewhat.  

Hopefully some of my musings will be of interest to other developers and architects.  And if not, I'm a believer in [the benefits of journalling](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-health-benefits-of-journaling/) so it may just help me enhance that sense of equilibrium most of us wish for.

I write music and play keyboards as a reasonably serious hobby too.  Even though I like my day job a lot, once the music bug has bitten, you never really recover!

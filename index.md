## Hi! ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤š

### About me

I'm a web developer, system architect and sometimes musician that lives in Sydney, Australia.

Professionally, I've been involved in building and fixing web systems for over 20 years, particularly e-commerce systems, recently for [Made.com Designs](https://www.made.com).  It's been a fun gig, and it was fun living in London in pre-COVID days, but it's time for something new and more local in 2021.

### Links

Here's a run-down of what I've been doing over the last few years here in [my linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-ozolins-749bb313/).

Also, I write music and play keyboards as a reasonably serious hobby.  Even though I like my day job a lot, once the music bug has bitten, you never really recover. [Here are some tracks that I produced on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/grantoz).

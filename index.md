## Hi There! ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤š

### About Me

I'm a developer, system architect and sometimes musician that lives in Sydney, Australia.

I've been building and fixing web systems for over 20 years now, particularly in e-commerce, recently as E-commerc Architect for [Made.com Designs](https://www.made.com) (now sadly now no more). Working at scale in an environment that combined both macro and micro services was fun and educational.  London was great too, back in pre-COVID days, but during the pandemic I decided it was time to get a bit closer to home and the rest of the family.

I'm now working for [Foodbomb](https://foodbomb.com.au) as a SSE, at the moment primarily on integrations and legacy migrations and upgrades.

### Other Things

I studied music at University level, so I've a deep love for well-written interesting music, right across the spectrum from classical through jazz to electronic. I write music and play keyboards as a fairly serious hobby.  [Here are some tracks that I produced on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/grantoz). Right now I'm looking for the right band to play keyboards in!
